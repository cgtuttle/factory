Factory is my attempt to set up an example of a scoped, multitenant framework that uses Devise, Cancan, and Rolify to provide authentication, and role based authorization. The multitenant part should allow a user to be a member of multiple tenants, and should also allow a user to potentially administer several tenants at once, including the user attributes of each. This is a work in progress.
